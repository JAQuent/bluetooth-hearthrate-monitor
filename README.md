# bluetooth-hearthrate-monitor
A small command-line python-based app for monitoring, logging and visualising heart rate.

# Notes
I built this app only for me heavily relying on LLMs like ChatGPT, Copilot and Claude because I tried to find such an app but coudln't. Currently, it's only tested/developed for Ubuntu (22.04) using a *COOSPO* device. It might work for other cases but I haven't tried anything else. If someone wants to extend the support, I am happy to collaborate. Overtime I will add more functionality that I would like this app to have.
