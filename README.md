# bluetooth-hearthrate-monitor
A small command-line python-based app for monitoring, logging and visualising heart rate.

# Notes
I built this app only for me heavily relying on LLMs like ChatGPT, Copilot and Claude. It's only tested for Ubuntu using a *COOSPO* device. So far I only tried it with this device.
